They are often used to model some force, such as magnetic or gravitational force, as their position changes from a point in space, and their value also changes. But such a concept can also be applied to Generative Art! As a great tool to create impressive works with particle systems. The image below illustrates a fictitious representation of a flow field, where we use the angle of each of the grid vectors to move the red particle, drawing a curved line. It is possible to create an infinity of possible paths with this concept, in this App three different flow fields were implemented, one based on sine and cosine trigonometric functions, another based on constant straight lines, and the last one using non-continuous vectors for a little chaos üòà. Have a great experience! üéâ")

It is possible, for example, to produce many unique effects depending on the type of brush used, some image editing software is already capable of implementing an infinity type of brushes. In generative art it is no different, there is a constant effort to create new compositions from shapes and thus seek to reproduce real-life effects. This app makes use of basic geometric shapes such as triangles, squares, and circles to simulate brushes, you can also choose between filled or stroked shapes. Feel free to try, and have fun! ü•≥")
